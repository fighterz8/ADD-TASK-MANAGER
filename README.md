# Dual Monitor Timer

## Description

A simple yet efficient PyQt5-based timer application designed to run independently on dual monitors. The application comes with a central control panel that allows you to set the timer values for each monitor, start, pause, and reset the timers.

### Inspiration

The project is inspired by the need to effectively manage time during various tasks such as meetings, presentations, or even personal tasks. The dual-monitor setup allows you to keep track of two different timers at the same time, which can be extremely useful in various professional or personal scenarios. I personally find it hard to focus on one thing for too long, so I made something to manage my focus. 

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run `entrypoint.py` to start the application:
    ```bash
    python entrypoint.py
    ```

## Features

1. **Dual Monitor Support**: The application can run timers on two different monitors.
2. **Control Panel**: A centralized control panel for managing both timers.
3. **Start/Pause/Reset**: Provides basic control over timer functions.
4. **Slider for Time Input**: A slider for easy time input.
5. **Always on Top**: The timer windows stay on top of other applications for easy visibility.
